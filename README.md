# 32-bit-Floating-Point-Arithmetic-Unit-
Digital system Design Project .
designing a configurable 32-bit Floating Point Arithmetic Unit following IEEE 754-2008 standards, supporting single-precision floating-point addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The project emphasizes evaluation based on computational performance and resource efficiency. The design is being developed from scratch, without the use of any external libraries.
